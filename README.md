My personal site repo. All contributions are welcome (if you're editing the css, please edit the source scss files instead).

It's a Flask site that you can run with `gunicorn start:application` after installing the dependencies.

Everything in this repo that is owned by me (this excludes icons which I got from [icones](https://icones.js.org), fonts, and some images) are licenced under CC0.
